This repository aims to standardize my C code practices as much as possible.
Here, I will describe how I name different language constructs, the techniques I use, and the rules I follow.

This document consists of several sections, each residing in a different directory.
Each section consists of several subsections that are assembled into a single file, which represents the section.
Those section files are then assembled into the resulting document (README.md).
