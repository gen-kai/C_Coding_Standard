When defining custom types using syntax
```c
typedef type_name new_type_name
```
- Custom type names should use a delimiter-separated style, where the `underscore (_)` serves as the delimiter to separate words.
- All words in custom types must be concise and clear to understand.
- Custom types should always consist of at least 2 words.
- A word can be an actual alpha word, a number, or an abbreviation (only if this abbreviation is widely used and is clear to understand, such as `u` in `u_int`).
