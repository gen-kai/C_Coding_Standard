## Overview

This repository aims to standardize my C code practices as much as possible.
Here, I will describe how I name different language constructs, the techniques I use, and the rules I follow, etc.

### Section Overview

This section describes naming conventions I use when coding in C.

### Type Definitions

When defining custom types, such syntax is used:
`typedef type_name new_type_name`.
Custom type names use delimiter-separated style, where the underscore serves as the delimiter to separate words.

### Preprocessor Directives and Macros

### Function Names
