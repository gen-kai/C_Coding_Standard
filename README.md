# C Coding Standard
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)

## Overview

This repository aims to standardize my C code practices as much as possible.</br>
Here, I will describe how I name different language constructs, the techniques I use, and the rules I follow.</br>

This document consists of several sections, each residing in a different directory.</br>
Each section consists of several subsections that are assembled into a single file, which represents the section.</br>
Those section files are then assembled into the resulting document (README.md).

### Section Overview

This section describes naming conventions I use when coding in C.

### Type Definitions

When defining custom types, such syntax is used:

```c
typedef type_name new_type_name
```

Custom type names use a delimiter-separated style, where the underscore serves as the delimiter to separate words.

### Preprocessor Directives and Macros

### Function Names

Function names
